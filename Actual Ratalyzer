%decision tree in progress 
clc;clear; 
lolcoding = 1:1:20;
lolcoding2 = 1:1:20;
ratboy = lolcoding';
parameter = lolcoding2'; %okay so now rat number and data point will be side by side columns
parmeter(:) = 1; %from math knawledge approaching 1 means no pain because circle, assuming long axis is on the denominator, the smaller than one it is the more squinty the boy. 
% hopefully there's a strong correlation between these ratios and Pain. I
% don't know what he has to do with this though, since he died in season 8.
PAIN = [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;]; %populate this with data that states whether the rodent is in no pain (0), moderate pain (1), and war-torn orpan (2)
ratable = table(ratboy,PAIN,parameter); 
ratree = fitctree([ratboy,PAIN],parameter,'PredictorNames',{'no pain','moderate pain','severe pain'});
%if this works all rats should show to not be in pain. surprise! 
% it doesnt work. There's an issue with Fitctree, idk what's wrong with it. I'm gonna try stuff on matlab.
