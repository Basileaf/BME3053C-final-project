% don't know what he has to do with this though, since he died in season 8.
PAIN = [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;]; %populate this with data that states whether the rodent is in no pain (0), moderate pain (1), and war-torn orpan (2)

bettertable = table(ratboy,PAIN, parameter);
ratree = fitctree(ratable, "PAIN", 'PredictorNames',"parameter");
display(ratree); 
%progress has been made! this will run now, but i don't really know if it runs properly, ie if it does what i want it to.
